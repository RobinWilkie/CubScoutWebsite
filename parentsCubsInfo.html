				<p>
				For Cubs, excitement and adventure are key. Their programme offers a huge variety of activities surrounding 
				areas of fitness, global and beliefs; whilst allowing them to be creative and get involved in their local communities. 
				Cubs are introduced to exciting outdoor skills and take part in adventurous activities, as well as camps and residential experiences.
				The Cub Pack is the second section of the Scout Group following on from Beavers. Cub Scouts are young people aged between 8 and 10 ½.  
				There is core flexibility in the age range:  young people can join from age 7½ and can move to Scouts between age 10 and 11.  It may sometimes be 
				appropriate to extend this flexibility for young people with additional needs. For further information, see our guidance on age range flexibility.
				Structure
				A Cub Pack is usually organised into small groups called Sixes, each headed up by an older Cub called a Sixer, and often with a Seconder as well. 
				Sixes can be used in a number of ways to facilitate the organisation of the Cub Scout Pack. They may provide a ‘home’ area for Cub Scouts to gather 
				at points at the start, during or at the end of the Pack meeting.
				Activities
				During their time in the Pack, Cub Scouts will get a chance to try a wide range of different activities as well as going on trips, days out, and on camps.
